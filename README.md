It Contains search algorithm implementations written in C. It covers both uninformed (BFS, DFS) and informed search strategies (Beam Search, Oracle Search, Branch and Bound with heuristics). These are several implementations search algorithms, including:
1. BMS (Exhaustic Search )
2. DFS
3. BFS
4. DFS+BFS
5. DFS + History
6. BFS + History
7. Hill climbing
8. Beam Search
9. HC + History
10. BS + History
11. Oracle
12. Branch & Bound Algorithm
13. Branch & Bound + Estimated Heuristic
14. A*
